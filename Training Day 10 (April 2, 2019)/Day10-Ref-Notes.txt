Character based stream classes
------------------------------------
InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter


FileReader and FileWriter


BufferedReader and BufferedWriter



Byte based stream classes
------------------------------------

FileInputStream	and FileOutputStream


BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream


DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
--------------------------------------------
	-> these stream classes are called as Formatted Data Stream classes
	-> used to perform read/write operations on primitive data and strings


	.readInt()		.writeInt()
	.readDouble()		.writeDouble()
	.readLine()		.write()
	.readUTF()		.writeUTF()
	.readXXX()		.writeXXX()

ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream
-----------------------------------------------

	-> read/write objects to/from the streams
	*-> the objects must be serializable


*=> Serialization
------------------------------
	-> Serialization is the process of converting an object into sequence of bytes
	-> it converts state of an object into byte stream

	-> to make an object serializable, we need to implmenet "Serializable" interface


	-> Serializable is a "Marker interface"

		class XXXX implements Serializable {

		}

*=>SerialVersionUID
-------------------------------
	->The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number
	->used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes 
		for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization




Multithreading / Multitasking
-------------------------------

	-> executing several tasks simultaneously


	1. process based multitasking



	2. thread based multitasking
		-> executing diff parts of the same process simultaneously
		-> sub process / part 


Thread Scheduler
----------------------
	-> TS is a part of JVM, responsible to schedule the execution of threads


main	t1	t2	t3	t4	t5


Thread Class
-----------------------



How to create a new thread
---------------------------------

	1. by extending Thread class
	
		class MyThread extends Thread{
			//override run() method
			public void run(){
				
				//code
			}

		}

		MyThread mythread1 = new MyThread();
		mythread1.start();

	2. by implementing Runnable interface 

		class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
			
			public void run() {

			}
		}


Thread class constructors
--------------------------------

	new Thread()

	new Thread(Runnable target)

	new Thread(Runnable target, String name)


How to pause a thread
----------------------------

	Thread.sleep(30000);

	*==> you can't pause a thread from another thread
	*==> only the thread itself can pause its execution

	*==> a sleeping thread can be interrupted by another thread


How to interrupt a thread
-----------------------------

	t1.interrupt()

	-> we can stop or resume the execution of a thread 


How to make a thread wait for other thread
-------------------------------------------------
	.start()
	    -> registers the thread with the thread scheduler
	    -> perfoms many other operations
	    -> invokes the run()
